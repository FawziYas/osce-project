# 🏥 OSCE Exam Platform

A full-featured **Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE)** management system built with Django 5.2. Designed for medical education institutions to create exams, manage sessions with multi-path rotation circuits, assign examiners, enroll students, score in real time (with offline support), and generate print-ready PDF reports — all from a single platform with full Arabic language support.

## ✨ Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Role Management
- Unified login portal with **role-based redirection** and teal-themed UI
- Force-change-password screen on first login (teal-themed, matching login)
- Four-tier access hierarchy:
  - **Superuser** — full system access including Django admin
  - **Admin** — manage coordinators, examiners, exams, sessions, reports
  - **Coordinator** — manage exams and sessions
  - **Examiner** — access examiner interface for scoring
- Activity-based session timeouts (5 min for admin/coordinator, 30 min for examiners)
- Rate-limited login via `django-axes`
- Admin gateway token restricted to staff users only (not leaking to examiner templates)

### 📋 Exam & Course Management
- Create and manage OSCE exams linked to **departments** and **courses** with **ILOs** (Intended Learning Outcomes) and **themes**
- Support for Year-4 (JR) and Year-6 (SR) course tiers
- Courses are linked to departments; exam wizard auto-filters courses by chosen department
- Stations with **checklist items** — each item has points, rubric type (binary/partial/scale), category, criticality flag, and ILO linkage
- Station template library for reusable checklist patterns
- Soft delete with restore and permanent delete (admin/superuser only)

### 🏢 Department & Coordinator Management
- Create and manage **departments** (e.g. Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, Surgery)
- Assign coordinators to departments with one of three positions:
  - **Head** — one per department, primary responsible
  - **RTA** — multiple allowed, academic support role
  - **Organizer** — exam logistics coordinator
- Courses are linked to departments; exams inherit department from the selected course
- Department displayed in sidebar for logged-in coordinators

### 🔄 Sessions, Paths & Rotation
- Create exam sessions (morning/afternoon) with configurable start times
- Multi-path rotation circuits (e.g. 5 paths per session, 10 per exam)
- Identical station names and checklists replicated across all paths
- Students assigned to specific paths with sequence numbers
- Automatic student redistribution across paths

### 👥 User & Examiner Management
- Create and manage examiners and coordinators
- Bulk import examiners via CSV/Excel
- Examiner assignment to specific stations per session per path
- Password defaults to a configurable setting (not username)

### 📊 Real-time Scoring
- Examiner scores students station-by-station through a dedicated interface
- Offline-capable examiner PWA with background sync
- Session status validation — scoring only allowed when session is `in_progress`
- Assignment verification — examiners can only score stations they are assigned to
- Ownership checks on all scoring record updates

### 📈 Reports & PDF Generation
- Session-level student results with **Total / Max mark** display
- Percentage and pass/fail indicators per student
- **Session Report PDF** (report code: `RPT-XXXX-XXXXXXXX`):
  - A4 portrait format with proper margins (20mm / 15mm / 25mm / 15mm)
  - 5 sections: Session Overview, Participants Summary, Examiner Assignments, Paths & Stations Breakdown, Student List
  - Repeating fixed footer on every printed page with "CONFIDENTIAL" notice
  - Page-break rules preventing mid-row and mid-section cuts
  - Full Arabic text support — browser-native rendering (HarfBuzz / DirectWrite)
  - RTL direction preserved; Arabic name cells use `white-space: nowrap`
- Excel (XLSX) export for all reports
- CSV raw data export with optimized queries

### 🛡 Security (Audited & Hardened)
- **CSRF protection** on all forms and scoring AJAX calls (removed unnecessary `@csrf_exempt`)
- **API path protection** — middleware blocks `/api/creator/` for non-creator roles (not just `/creator/`)
- **Examiner assignment verification** on all scoring endpoints (`get_session_students`, `start_marking`, `sync_offline_data`)
- **Session status validation** — `start_marking` rejects scoring for completed/cancelled sessions
- **JSON body validation** — all 13+ `json.loads()` calls wrapped in try/except returning 400
- **Sync ownership checks** — `sync_offline_data` verifies examiner owns existing records before updating
- **Admin token scoping** — `SECRET_ADMIN_URL` only injected for authenticated staff users
- **Audit logging** for all critical actions (login, scoring, admin operations)
- Django admin restricted to superusers only
- Full audit report: see `SECURITY_PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md`

### ⚡ Performance (Optimized)
- **N+1 query elimination** across all major API endpoints:
  - `export_raw_csv` — reduced from O(n²) queries to 2 queries via `select_related()`
  - `get_exams` — station/session counts via `annotate()` instead of per-row `.count()`
  - `get_session_summary` / `export_students_xlsx` — path lookups pre-fetched into dictionary
  - `courses` API — ILO and library item counts via `annotate()`
  - `export_stations_csv` — single query with `select_related('path')`
- **Bulk operations** — `redistribute_students` uses `bulk_update()` instead of per-row `.save()`
- **Database indexes** — added `db_index=True` to `ExamSession.status` and `SessionStudent.status`
- Full performance report: see `SECURITY_PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md`

### 🎨 UI / Theme
- Teal-themed login and force-change-password pages
- Examiner interface with custom header colors and dashboard styling
- Responsive design for mobile examiner use during exams

### ⚡ Caching & Async Processing
- **Redis-backed caching** (with in-memory fallback) for high-traffic data:
  - Department lists (30 min TTL)
  - Examiner list and stats (5 min TTL)
  - Session details (2 min TTL)
  - Dashboard statistics (5 min TTL)
- **Celery task queue** for long-running operations:
  - Async PDF report generation (with base64 result caching for polling)
  - Async bulk examiner XLSX import (with progress tracking in cache)
  - Periodic dashboard statistics computation (every 5 min)
  - Nightly audit log cleanup (older than 365 days)
  - One-off session readiness validation before activation
- **Explicit cache invalidation** — all cache helpers auto-update after mutations (create/edit/delete)
- **Safe fallbacks** — all async operations degrade gracefully if Celery broker is unavailable
- Polling endpoints for frontend to check async task status (`/pdf-status/`, `/bulk-import-status/`)

### 🔐 Session Timeout & Redirect
- Fixed session timeout redirect to preserve the original requested page
- Login form captures `?next=` parameter and redirects after authentication
- Secure open-redirect prevention using Django's `url_has_allowed_host_and_scheme()`
